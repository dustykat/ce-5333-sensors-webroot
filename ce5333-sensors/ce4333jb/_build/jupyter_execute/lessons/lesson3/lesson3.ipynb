    "A simple sensor system to measure temperature without direct contact. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to use an IR sensor to measure temperature of objects without contact.  The sensor and code can be adapted to practical uses, so although simplistic here - a little refinement can produce a useful tool for some engineering measurements. The motivating problem is measurement of thermal behavior of concrete mixtures as they cure - imbedding a thermal probe would be a legitimate approach, but here we want to explore remote measurement.  Unlike our PIR project, we now care about accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operation Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLX90614 sensor is manufactured by Melexis Microelectronics Integrated systems, it works on the principle of InfraRed thermopile sensor for temperature measurement. \n",
    "These sensors consist of two units embedded internally to give the temperature output. \n",
    "The first unit is the sensing unit which has an infrared detector which is followed by the second unit which performs the computation of the data with Digital signal processing (DSP). \n",
    "\n",
    "This sensor works based on the [Stefan-Boltzmann law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law) that states the power radiated by a black body is proportional to its temperature. In simple terms, any object emits IR energy and the intensity of that will be directly proportional to the temperature of that object. MLX90614 sensor converts the detected value into 17-bit value using an on-board ADC that can be accessed using the I2C communication protocol. These sensors measure the ambient temperature as well as object temperature with the resolution calibration of 0.02°C. To learn more about the MLX90614 sensor, refer to the [MLX90614 Datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/MLX90614_rev001.pdf).\n",

    "## Hardware\n",

    "For this lesson we will use the MLX90614 IR Temperature Sensor. This sensor different from the PIR sensor in that it can give us object temperature and ambient temperature. You can buy it at Amazon and a few other sources for about \\$13 [https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-MLX90614ESF-Non-contact-Infrared-Temperature](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-MLX90614ESF-Non-contact-Infrared-Temperature/dp/B071VF2RWM/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3K12PBA02OOKG&keywords=MLX90614&qid=1642181841&sprefix=mlx90614%2Caps%2C483&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFFSVNCVDlCOFQ0MkQmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA2MDUzMzMzMEEyWlVOU1hYODdRJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzMzE4NzYzTFVMWkdOOEYzQU5SJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)  \n",

    "## I2C interface and libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "This sensor uses the I2C interface and will use a different set of libraries than the GPIO libraries used in the PIR sensor.  The I2C acronym stands for inter-integrated circuit and is a method designed to allow one chip to talk to another synchronously. \n",
    "\n",
    "> (from Wikipedia ...) I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit, eye-squared-C), alternatively known as I2C or IIC, is a synchronous, multi-controller/multi-target (master/slave), packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus invented in 1982 by Philips Semiconductors. It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our use it is just another way to access the sensor, because the module has an A/D built into it, I2C is a preferred approach.  We will still use the GPIO pins, but using the I2C interface reassigns them to specific parts of the SBC processor and interface hardware.\n",
