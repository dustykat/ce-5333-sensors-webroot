# Sensor System Integration for Civil Engineers - A Maker's Cookbook

This JupyterBook is a cookbook for building DIY sensor networks using Raspberry Pi computers.  The book is intended to provide the conceptual experience necessary to specify and operate professional sensor systems for Civil engineers.  While the professional systems are not usually based on a Raspberry Pi, the underlying concepts and principles are the same and lessons learned on these "toys" will serve as useful analogs to professional systems.

GitHub Repository This entire course (book, labs, and exercises) is contained in a public repository on GitHub https://github.com/dustykat/ce-5333-sensors-webroot

> How to Use
>1. Clone the entire repository to /var/www/html/ce-5333-sensors-webroot. Have your main index point to this directory i.e. `http://your-fqdn-server.org/ce-5333-sensors-webroot/` You can see working example at [http:/54.243.252.9/ce-5333-sensors-webroot/](http:/54.243.252.9/ce5333-sensors-webroot/)
>2. If you plan to modify things, many of the internal links use IP/hostname == `54.243.252.9`, so you will have to change these addresses to your server. A string editor *sed* with global search/replace can usually make the changes seamlessly, but you will need to verify the new links 

- Materials herein come from many sources. Sources in notebooks are at least cited by a URL. As the content is matured, proper citations are to be inserted.
- The 3-Readings directory contains copyrighted materials and should be exposed with care on a web server; generally because no one reads anymore, its probably safe enough to protect using an .htaccess approach. In my courses we access things through the syllabus links, and the syllabus is accessed through our LMS (Blackboard)
