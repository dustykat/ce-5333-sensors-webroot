<p>
A hands-on "maker" course to develop homebrew sensor and data aquisition tools. 
Useful for beginning researchers to collect data at low cost for screening level data. 
The sensors and programs are adaptable to professional use.  
Entire systems will be built and demonstrated -- the projects are mostly water related, but concepts are transferable to other Civil sub-disciplines.
Intended for graduate students with minimal electronics skills, and minimal computer administration skills. 
Students should know how to solder and have had a circuits class somewhere. 
</p>
<p> 
Upon successful completion of this course, the participant will have:<br>
1. Provisioned a single-board computer(Raspberry PI; Hardkernel XU4; Arduino, etc) to run a Linux instance and host a wireless network.<br>
2. Construct Analog-to-Digital Converter using MP3008 microprocessor.<br>
3. Select and attach sensors to the computer system using the GPIO pins. Sensor type based on environmental variable of interest and data type (counting, voltage level, current level)<br>
4. Write custom Python scripts to control senors, collect, and process data.<br>
5. Use custom built system to control a device based on sensor input (by activating a relay on demand).<br>
6. Deploy  onto a second SBC and control by wireless remote procedure calls.<br>

The following are expected:<br>
1. Completed an introductory course with some programming (ENGI 1315). <br>
2. Graduate Student in Civil Engineering. <br>
3. Ability to solder. <br>

There is a substantial hardware component and students need to obtain about $300 in supplies to build the sensor projects.<br>
1. Raspberry Pi3B+ or 4(2GB).<br>
2. Raspberry Pi ZeroW.<br>
3. Power supplies for above; 16GB Micro-SD Class 10 for OS images; A USB keyboard-mouse will be useful; A monitor is useful until have the systems configured and can run headless. <br>
4. A breadboard and connection wire kit. <br>
5. Sensors for selected projects. (about $10-$20 per project) <br>

This course uses the Python programming language to communicate with the sensor-GPIO. <br>
Students are expected to also be able to use MS Excel, MS Image Editor, and MS Word.  <br>
